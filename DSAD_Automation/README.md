# DSA Diary Automation

Started: 2025-12-24

This automation is part of my process to automate my Learn In Public activities so that I can make more time for high-value learning and
practice work.

I maintain a personal repository where I save my solutions for DSA problems I solve. I am probably the millionth person to do this, but the value-added
extension to this practice is this automation which allows me to use an LLM to document a kind of diary entry for each problem I solve, and then a. Post
it to my personal website and b. Post promotional content pointing to the diary.

Stack:
- Python (Core script)
- GitHub Actions (Automation)

Learnt about:
- Google Gemini API in Python
- Regular Expressions
- GitHub Secrets
- Environment variables (.env)
