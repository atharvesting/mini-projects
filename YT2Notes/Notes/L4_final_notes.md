*   **Geometric Correction:** Geometric correction, also known as orthorectification, involves correcting for distortions in the image caused by the satellite's orbit, sensor geometry, and other factors. This process ensures that the image is projected onto a plane with no distortion, allowing for accurate superimposition of images from different sensors or sources.
*   **Radiometric Correction:** Radiometric correction involves removing the effects of atmospheric scattering and absorption on the image. This process involves correcting for factors such as atmospheric transmittance, reflectivity, and other radiometric properties.

#### Importance of Atmospheric Correction

Atmospheric correction is essential in remote sensing because it allows for accurate interpretation and analysis of data. Without proper atmospheric correction, images may appear distorted or have incorrect values, leading to inaccurate conclusions.

> **[Context Note]:** Atmospheric scattering refers to the scattering of light by particles in the atmosphere, such as water vapor, dust, and pollutants. This scattering can cause distortions in satellite images, making it essential to correct for these effects.

#### Applications of Atmospheric Correction

### Fundamentals of GIS and Metadata

#### Introduction

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) rely on fundamental data sets to function effectively. These data sets provide the foundation for analysis, mapping, and decision-making in various fields.

#### Fundamental Data Sets Required for GIS

*   **Boundary**: A boundary is a vector data that represents an area or region of interest. It serves as the starting point for most GIS applications.
*   **Land Cover**: Land cover refers to the type of land use or land cover within a specific area. This can include vegetation, water bodies, infrastructure, and other features.
*   **Infrastructure Information**: Infrastructure information includes details about roads, bridges, buildings, and other man-made structures within an area.

#### Metadata

> **[Context Note]:** Metadata refers to data that provides information about other data. It describes the characteristics of a dataset, such as its origin, creation date, spatial resolution, and any errors or limitations.

Metadata is essential for understanding the context and relevance of a dataset. It enables users to make informed decisions about which datasets to use and how to interpret their results.

#### Example Use Case

Suppose you are working on a carbon credit project and want to observe soil and water levels in a specific area. You would need to:

*   Collect boundary data for the study area
*   Gather land cover information, such as vegetation types or water bodies
*   Identify infrastructure features, like roads or bridges
*   Use metadata to understand the characteristics of your datasets, including their spatial resolution and any potential errors

By understanding these fundamental concepts, you can effectively apply GIS techniques to analyze and visualize your data.

### Carbon Credit Project Observation

The discussion revolves around observing soil and water levels in a carbon credit project using IoT devices and satellite images.

#### Background Information

Carbon credits are certificates issued to organizations that reduce greenhouse gas emissions or invest in projects that promote sustainable development. The use of IoT (Internet of Things) devices and satellite imaging for monitoring soil and water levels can provide valuable insights into the environmental impact of agricultural activities.

#### Technical Feasibility

The feasibility of using satellite images to analyze water and carbon percentage day by day is limited due to the revisit period of active remote sensors, such as Sentinel. The revisit period refers to the time interval between two consecutive passes over a specific location. For example, Sentinel-2 has a revisit period of 5 days.

> **[Context Note]:** Revisit period: The time interval between two consecutive passes over a specific location by an active remote sensor.

#### Integration with IoT Data

If sensors are installed in the study area to collect data on humidity, rainfall, or solar incident, integrating these data with satellite images may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the environmental impact. This approach can help identify areas where carbon credits can be applied.

#### Collaboration and Resources

The speaker is working on a carbon credit project covering 2,000 farmers in Chhattisgarh. They have developed a panel to create polygon structures based on GPS data and have collected soil and water level data. The speaker suggests collaborating with the Central University of Chhattisgarh, where one of their students has completed a PhD in remote sensing and has worked on biomass estimation and other aspects of forest management.

> **[Context Note]:** Biomass estimation: The process of measuring the amount of organic matter in a given area, often used to assess forest health and carbon sequestration potential.

### Understanding NDVI and Satellite Imagery

NDVI stands for Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, a widely used metric in remote sensing to quantify vegetation health. It is calculated by subtracting the normalized difference between near-infrared (NIR) and red (R) bands from 1.

> **[Context Note]:** The NDVI formula is: NDVI = (NIR - R) / (NIR + R). This calculation helps distinguish between areas with dense vegetation, which typically reflect more NIR light, and those without vegetation, such as water bodies or barren lands.

### Satellite Imagery and Bands

Satellite images contain multiple bands, each capturing different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. These bands can be broadly categorized into:

* Visible bands (e.g., red, green, blue): reflecting visible light
* Infrared (IR) bands: reflecting IR radiation
* Near-infrared (NIR) bands: reflecting NIR radiation

The number of bands in a satellite image can vary depending on the sensor and its purpose. For example, some images may have 10-12 bands, including spectral bands that capture specific wavelengths.

### Application of NDVI

NDVI is useful for:

* Forest management
* Agriculture
* Biomass analysis
* Monitoring vegetation health

By analyzing NDVI values in satellite images, researchers can identify areas with dense vegetation and those without. This information can be used to inform decisions related to land use, conservation, and resource management.

### Example Scenario

In a study involving three researchers:

1. An urban planner interested in settlement areas
2. A colleague studying vegetation cover
3. Someone focused on water bodies
4. A fourth person tasked with interpreting all aspects of the earth's surface

### Supervised and Unsupervised Image Classification

Supervised image classification refers to a method of categorizing images into predefined classes based on labeled training data. In this approach, the system is trained on a dataset with known labels, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships between features and class labels.

**Definition:** > **[Context Note]:** Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data, using the relationship between input features and output labels to make predictions.

Unsupervised image classification, on the other hand, involves categorizing images into classes without prior knowledge of the class labels. In this approach, the system relies on patterns and relationships within the data itself to identify clusters or groups of similar images.

**Definition:** > **[Context Note]:** Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm identifies patterns and relationships in unlabeled data, often resulting in the discovery of hidden structures or groupings.

The key difference between supervised and unsupervised classification lies in the level of human intervention required. Supervised classification relies on labeled training data, whereas unsupervised classification uses algorithms to identify patterns and relationships within the data itself.

**Key differences:**

* **Accuracy:** Supervised classification typically achieves higher accuracy than unsupervised classification, as the system is trained on labeled data.
* **Human Intervention:** Supervised classification requires human labeling of training data, while unsupervised classification relies on algorithms to identify patterns and relationships.
* **Complexity:** Unsupervised classification can be more complex, as the algorithm must identify patterns and relationships within large datasets.

In practice, supervised image classification is often used in applications such as object detection, facial recognition, and medical imaging. Unsupervised classification has applications in areas like image segmentation, anomaly detection, and clustering.
