* Spatial resolution is related to the size and shape of individual pixels in an image.

### Spatial Resolution

* Spatial resolution refers to the ability of a sensor or imaging system to capture fine details within an image.
* A higher spatial resolution means that smaller features can be distinguished more clearly, while a lower spatial resolution means that finer details will appear coarser.

#### Pixel Size and Resolution

* The size of individual pixels in an image is directly related to the level of detail that can be captured.
* A pixel size of 30 m x 30 m would result in a resolution of approximately 30 meters, meaning that features larger than this size would not be distinguishable.

### Technical Study Notes: Near-Polar Orbit

#### Main Idea

Near-polar orbit refers to an orbital path around the Earth that is close to, but not exactly at, the polar regions. This type of orbit is characterized by a small angle between the satellite's trajectory and the axis of rotation of the Earth.

#### Sub-Details

* The satellite's orbit is not a perfect circle and does not pass directly through the North or South Pole.
* Instead, it follows a curved path that maintains a constant angle with respect to the Earth's axis of rotation.
* This angle is typically around 90° (one-quarter turn) due to the Earth's slightly ellipsoidal shape.

### Technical Definition: Near-Polar Orbit

A near-polar orbit is defined as an orbital path that satisfies the following conditions:

1. The satellite's periapsis (closest point to the center of the Earth) lies within 35° latitude of the equator.
2. The satellite's apoapsis (farthest point from the center of the Earth) lies within 90° latitude of the equator.

#### Formula

The angle between the satellite's orbit and the Earth's axis of rotation can be calculated using the following formula:

θ = arccos(-tan(Δlat)/cos(Δλ))

where θ is the angle, Δlat is the difference in latitude between the satellite's periapsis and apoapsis, and Δλ is the difference in longitude.

### Technical Constant: Sun Synchronous Orbit

A sun synchronous orbit is an orbital path that passes over the same point on the Earth at the same local solar time for each orbit. This means that the satellite's orbit is synchronized with the position of the Sun relative to the Earth.

#### Formula

The equation of motion for a sun synchronous orbit can be described by the following formula:

r(t) = r0 + (r1 - r0) \* sin^2(Δt/2)

where r(t) is the radial distance from the center of the Earth at time t, r0 and r1 are the radial distances at periapsis and apoapsis, respectively, Δt is the orbital period, and Δt/2 is half the orbital period.

### Technical Satellite Name: TOPEX/Poseidon

The TOPEX/Poseidon satellite was a NASA-ESA joint mission that operated from 1992 to 2006. It was launched into a sun synchronous orbit at an altitude of approximately 700 km and completed two orbits every 24 hours.

### Satellite Orbit Basics

* A satellite will always pass over a location at a particular time, given a specific orbit.
	+ The Earth is approximately spherical in shape.
	+ Satellites are placed in orbit around the Earth to capture images or collect data from a fixed point on the planet.
	+ The time of day and location determine when a satellite passes over a particular area.

### Synchronous Orbit

* A satellite will be synchronous with the sun if it is moving at the same rate as the sun's apparent motion across the sky.
	+ This occurs when an orbit has an altitude of approximately 35,786 km (22,236 miles) above the Earth's equator.
	+ The period of the satellite's orbit must match the solar day (approximately 24 hours).
* Synchronous orbits are designed to maintain a constant angle with respect to the sun, ensuring that the satellite passes over a specific location at the same time every day.

### Near-Polar Orbit

* Satellites in near-polar orbits have an altitude of approximately 800-1,200 km (500-750 miles) above the Earth's equator.
	+ These satellites pass over the same part of the Earth repeatedly, allowing for repeated imaging or data collection.
* The period of a near-polar orbit is approximately 90 minutes, which allows for daily imaging of the same region.

### Radiation Properties and Sunlight

* Satellites in different orbits experience different radiation properties and sunlight angles due to their varying altitudes and positions relative to the sun.
	+ This affects the quality and accuracy of the data collected by the satellite.
	+ Satellites are designed to minimize the effects of these variations, ensuring consistent and reliable data.

### Orbit Design

* Satellites are designed with specific orbits in mind to ensure optimal performance and data collection.
	+ The orbit's altitude, inclination, and period must be carefully chosen to match the mission requirements and the characteristics of the Earth's atmosphere.

### Formula for Satellite Orbits

* Not explicitly mentioned in the transcript, but relevant formulas include:
	+ Kepler's equation: a perturbation method used to determine the position of a satellite in orbit.

* Satellites can be categorized into three main types:
	+ Sun Synchronous: appears stationary, monitoring a particular area continuously
	+ Remote Sensing Satellite: Earth Observation satellites that collect data about the Earth's surface and atmosphere
	+ Geostationary: orbiting at an altitude where it appears stationary, covering a larger area

#### Satellites as Suns

* A satellite is considered a "sun" when:
	+ It appears stationary in the sky
	+ It is monitoring a particular area continuously
	+ Its orbit period is synchronized with the Earth's rotation (24 hours)

#### Geostationary Satellites

* Characteristics:
	+ Orbiting at an altitude of approximately 35,786 km
	+ Appear stationary in the sky
	+ Covering a larger area due to their higher altitude
	+ Orbit period should be synchronized with the Earth's rotation (24 hours)
* Examples: Intelsat, SES, and Inmarsat

#### Remote Sensing Satellites

* Characteristics:
	+ Collect data about the Earth's surface and atmosphere
	+ Can observe multiple continents or even entire hemispheres
	+ Orbit period may not be synchronized with the Earth's rotation (e.g., 90-minute or 16-day orbits)

#### Geostationary Satellite Requirements

* Orbital altitude should be sufficient to cover a larger area:
	+ Altitude > 35,786 km for coverage of entire hemisphere
	+ Altitude > 36,000 km for coverage of multiple continents
* Orbit period must be synchronized with the Earth's rotation (24 hours)

#### Formula and Constant

* Orbital Period = Time taken by satellite to complete one orbit around the Earth
* For a geostationary satellite, Orbital Period should be equal to the Earth's sidereal day (24 hours)
* Example: If a satellite orbits the Earth at an altitude of 36,000 km, its orbital period will also be 24 hours

#### Height and Coverage Area

* The higher the altitude, the larger the coverage area:
	+ Altitude > 35,786 km for geostationary satellites
	+ Altitude > 36,000 km for remote sensing satellites covering multiple continents

* However, corrections can be applied in satellite imaging to reduce distortion.
* Aerial photography is more difficult to correct due to the complex geometry involved.

### Mathematical Description of Nadir Point

* The nadir point is the shortest distance from a satellite to the Earth's surface.
* Mathematically, it can be described as a vertical ray or an inclined angle at 90°.
* The perpendicular distance between the satellite and the Earth's surface is the nadir point.

### Formula for Nadir Point

* Not explicitly mentioned in the transcript, but it can be represented by the following formula:
Nadir point = (Satellite altitude / Earth radius) \* cos(altitude angle)

where:

* Satellite altitude: the height of the satellite above the Earth's surface.
* Earth radius: the radius of the Earth.
* Altitude angle: the angle between the satellite's orbital plane and the Earth's equatorial plane.

### Other Relevant Concepts
